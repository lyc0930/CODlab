2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK100MHZ_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst/O, DDU/CLK100MHZ
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree
